      <p className="text-justify mb-4">
        Klipp reserves the right to modify these Terms without notice. Continual
        Klipp usage post-modification implies acceptance of the revised Terms.

        discontinue use and contact Klipp (klipp.bio@gmail.com) to terminate
        your account, subject to the new Terms otherwise.
